    <h1>Choosing the Right Property Management Company in Hawaii: What to Ask</h1>
    <div class="meta">February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; 10 min read</div>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>There are dozens of property management companies on Oahu. Some are excellent. Most are mediocre. A few will cost you more in deferred maintenance, vendor markups, and missed problems than you'd ever pay in fees.</p>

    <p>The stakes are higher in Hawaii than most markets. Your property is in a humid, salt-air environment that's thousands of miles from you. Your manager is your eyes, your voice, and your first line of defense. Getting this decision wrong is expensive.</p>

    <p>Here's the framework to get it right.</p>

    <h2>First: Understand What Type of Manager You Actually Need</h2>
    <p>Not all property management is the same. There are three distinct categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vacation Rental Managers</strong> — focused on short-term rentals (Airbnb/VRBO). Revenue optimization, guest communications, turnover cleaning. <em>Requires a Hawaii real estate license.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Rental Managers</strong> — tenant placement, lease management, maintenance coordination for annual rentals. <em>Also requires a Hawaii real estate license.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Estate/Property Stewardship Managers</strong> — focused on property preservation, vendor oversight, inspections, and owner-focused reporting for homes that aren't actively rented. <em>Different licensing landscape — verify credentials.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you hire a vacation rental manager to steward an estate, or an estate manager who lacks relationships with the right vendors, you're mismatched from day one.</p>

    <h2>The Interview: 12 Questions That Separate Good Managers from Great Ones</h2>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">1. How many properties are you currently managing?</div>
      <p>You want this number to feel sustainable. A solo operator managing 50+ properties can't give your estate real attention. A boutique firm managing 10–20 premium properties can.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">2. What does a standard weekly inspection look like — and what does the report include?</div>
      <p>Great managers have a written checklist and deliver photo-documented reports. If they talk vaguely about "checking in," keep looking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">3. How do you handle vendor relationships — do you markup vendor invoices?</div>
      <p>Some managers take 15–30% markups on all vendor work without disclosing it. Ask explicitly. Good managers charge a transparent management fee and pass vendor costs through at cost (or at negotiated rates they share with you).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">4. What's your emergency response protocol? Give me a specific example.</div>
      <p>You want to hear a real story — a burst pipe at 2 AM, a hurricane warning, an unauthorized person on the property. What happened? Who called who? How fast? What was resolved?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">5. What are your preferred vendors for HVAC, plumbing, roofing, and pest control?</div>
      <p>Good managers have licensed, pre-vetted, pre-agreed-rate relationships with key trades. If they name vendors and can speak to their quality, that's a green flag. If they're vague, they're likely figuring it out per-incident — which costs you money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">6. How do you communicate with owners, and how often?</div>
      <p>You want structured reporting: a weekly or monthly written summary, plus immediate alerts for anything above a defined threshold. "We're available if you call" is not a communication plan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">7. What's your approval process for maintenance and repairs?</div>
      <p>There should be a clear threshold: under $X, they handle it; above $X, they get your sign-off. Surprises on your invoice mean the approval protocol doesn't exist or isn't respected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">8. Are you — or is your firm — licensed by the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs?</div>
      <p>Depending on what services they offer, they may need a Hawaii real estate broker's license. Ask directly. Check the DCCA database yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">9. What insurance do you carry?</div>
      <p>They should carry General Liability and Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance. Ask for a Certificate of Insurance. Vendors entering your property should also be insured — does your manager verify this?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">10. Can you walk me through a situation where something went wrong on a client's property?</div>
      <p>You want honesty and competence. Everyone has a "something went wrong" story. What matters is how they handled it, how they communicated it to the owner, and what systems they put in place afterward.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">11. What's your termination policy?</div>
      <p>If things don't work out, how do you exit? Is there a penalty? How are keys, access codes, and vendor relationships handed off? A manager who makes it hard to leave is a red flag.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-box">
      <div class="q">12. Can I speak with two or three current clients — specifically absentee owners?</div>
      <p>Any good manager will say yes immediately. Hesitation means something.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Red Flags to Walk Away From</h2>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>No written inspection reports.</strong> "We drive by and everything looked fine" is not property management.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>Opaque vendor markups.</strong> If they won't answer "do you markup vendor invoices" directly, assume the answer is yes and it's significant.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>Too many properties per manager.</strong> Quality attention requires capacity. A 60-property roster with one manager means you're getting reactive, not proactive service.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>No insurance.</strong> This is non-negotiable. If something happens at your property — on their watch, with their vendor — you need coverage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>Vague communication plans.</strong> "We'll let you know if something comes up" means you're the last to find out, not the first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="red-flag">
      <p>🚩 <strong>Long-term lock-in contracts without a clear exit clause.</strong> Good managers are confident in their service. They don't need to trap you.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What the Fee Structure Should Look Like</h2>
    <p>For estate management (non-rental), expect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly retainer: $1,500–$8,000 depending on property size and scope of services</li>
      <li>Vendor invoices passed through at cost (or at pre-negotiated rates shared transparently)</li>
      <li>No hidden markups or "administrative fees" on top of vendor bills</li>
      <li>Any additional services (event prep, seasonal deep clean coordination) quoted separately in advance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The cheapest manager is never the right manager for a luxury property. What you're paying for is judgment, relationships, and accountability — not a body that shows up once a month and sends a bill.</p>

    <h2>The Decision</h2>
    <p>After your interviews, you should be evaluating three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Trust</strong> — Do you believe this person will act in your interest when you're not watching? Because you won't be.</li>
      <li><strong>Systems</strong> — Do they have documented processes, or are they improvising? Improvisation at $5M of real estate is unacceptable.</li>
      <li><strong>Fit</strong> — Do they understand your property, your standards, and what "well-managed" looks like to you? A mismatch in expectations is the root of most bad management relationships.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>"Your property manager is the most important person in your Hawaii property ownership experience. Hire slow, vet thoroughly, and don't confuse cheap with good."</p>
